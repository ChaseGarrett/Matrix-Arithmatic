# Matrix-Arithmatic

This is code I helped write for the second half of my numerical analysis class in college. The code takes in a 
square matrix of a size specified by the user, as long as it's 3x3 and larger, then it performs some matrix
arithmetic, and rutners the necessary information. The code can execute Gaussian, Partial Pivoting, and 
Scaled Partial Pivoting, returning the solution vector and the number of evaluations it had to get the
solution vector.

To run, download the code and open it in the Python IDE of your choosing and follow the prompts on screen.
Just enter in any size matrix, a 3x3 or greater, and values of a matrix you want to solve.
